# Adelem

A simple Twitch bot to moderate chat using a really horribly coded console GUI made in Java Swing.

## Features:
- A lockdown command using !lockdown,
  * !lockdown <params>
  * !lockdown f 30m
  * !lockdown s
  * !lockdown disable
- A non-fancy console GUI which you can run commands through, [I suck at making GUIs](https://i.gyazo.com/9d929e515969d7825c96382db47bf909.png)

**More TBA, join my Discord for support w/ bugs and other things.** (Working on a runnable executable)
